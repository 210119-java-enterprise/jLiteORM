How is work being divided up between Framework and bankingApp, boundary between the two?

Framework
-Scrapes the POJOs in order to create tables
-Replaces the logic in the bankingApp DAOs with concise statements/method calls to DB
-The above would involve moving the SQL and JDBC logic to the framework
-Above logic would be inside the CRUD repos

bankingApp
-Will do user input and validation
-Will still initiate calls to database
-Connection and session management?

How does my framework initiate?
-Initiates via a Configuration object creation inside bankingApp main
-User hand inputs the annotated classes.
