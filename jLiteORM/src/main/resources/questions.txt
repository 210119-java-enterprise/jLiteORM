-How does my framework initiate?
will a hibernate object get created in the bankingApplication's main?
will static blocks execute upon loading?
How do I get the name of the class that I have annotated/am scraping
in generic fashion, from annotations?


-Do I need to deal with connections and sessions in framework or handled in bankingApp?
