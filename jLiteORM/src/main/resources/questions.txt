How is work being divided up between Framework and bankingApp, boundary between the two?

Framework(what I think it does)
-Scrapes the POJOs in order to create tables
-Replaces some part of the DAOs in the bankingApp with general CRUD SQL statements

bankingApp
-User input and validation
-Connection and session management

How does my framework initiate?
-will a hibernate object get created in the bankingApplication's main?
-will static blocks execute upon loading?

How do I get the name of the class from annotations in generic way, can't hand input?
