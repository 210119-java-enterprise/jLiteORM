Left off working on the Getter annotation which has a GetterField class and the corresponding
method needs to be implemented in the Metamodel class, the getGetter method will populate an
array list of GetterField objects in the Metamodel class.  These should be accessible in the
EntityManager class. I need these because I am trying to implement the SQL statement + and
methods that follow it in a generic fashion. Specifically, the prepared statement stuff.
