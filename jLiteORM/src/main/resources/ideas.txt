Project ideas

-Based on Hibernate
My structure will fewer classes.

Hibernate structure/architecture classes:
1. Configuration object- Database connection, and class mapping setup.
-Think my bankingApp will take care of the connection.
2. Session factory object - Allows for session object to be instantiated.
-Think my bankingApp will take care of the session.
3. Session object - Makes physical connection to the DB.
-Think my bankingApp will take care of the connection.
4. Transaction object - Prob won't use this.
5. Query object - To retrieve data from the database and create objects.
6. Criteria objects - Used to create and execute object oriented criteria queries to retrieve objects.


-Annotations based- Means creating custom annotations
-Relies on reflection API - To scrape the classes/methods/fields of application that uses my framework.

- Can I reuse the connection and session classes from banking app?
