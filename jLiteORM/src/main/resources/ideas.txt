Project ideas

-Based on Hibernate
My structure may have fewer classes.

Hibernate structure/architecture classes:
1. Configuration object- Database connection, and class mapping setup.
2. Session factory object - Allows for session object to be instantiated.
3. Session object - Makes physical connection to the DB.
4. Transaction object - Prob won't use this.
5. Query object - To retrieve data from the database and create objects.
6. Criteria objects - Used to create and execute object oriented criteria queries to retrieve objects.


Expose to developer only - Entity manager, Session, Configuration, and maybe a transaction entity

-Useful method for serial values- Is annotation present
-Could put connection object inside a Session object
-Should create a connection pool, rather than on demand.
-Configuration class can build SessionFactory or EntityManager
-Session is connection + more.  Session could wrap the connection plus something else
